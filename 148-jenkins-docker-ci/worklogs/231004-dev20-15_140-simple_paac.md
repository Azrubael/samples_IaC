* 139 - Plugins for CI
----------------------
We have completed the stages:
- Jenkins setup [http://192.168.56.11:8080/];
- Nexus setup [http://192.168.56.12:8081];
- SonarQube setup [http://192.168.56.19/about or http://192.168.56.19:9000/about];
- Sequrity grops (actual for on AWS) [ports see above];

Now we'll install plusing:
+ Nexus plugin [can integrate Jenkins with Nexus service];
+ SonarQube plugin;
+ Git plugin [installed by default];
+ Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin [to write pipeline as a code];
+ BuildTimestamp [for versioning the artifact];
+ we'll be installing a few more pluging in the becoming lessons.

    $ vagrant reload jvm

* 140 - Pipeline As A Code Introduction
---------------------------------------
See 'userdata/JenkinsfileDemo'

*What is reallypipeline as a code?*
- It's Jenkins way of setting up pipeline automatically by using a file called Jenkinsfile.
- Jenkinsfile defines Stages in CI/CD Pipeline as we create jobs.
- Jenkinsfile is a text file with Pipeline DSL Syntax (it's very close to groovy).
- Jenkinsfile can be written in two syntaxes: scripted and declarative;
The declarative Jenkinsfile syntax is the way forward now, and we're going to use declarative syntax in our project.

*Pipeline Concepts*
*Pipeline*      is going to be the main block and everything insude pipeline will be executed by Jenkins.
*Node/Agent*    There are both settings. You can define where this pipeline can get executed on which Node or Which Agent.
*Stage*         There are stages where the actual execution happen. In stages you have steps. The steps could be commands like 'maven' or 'git' or 'upload' artifact to Nexus etc.

-------------
    $ vim Jenkinsfile
pipeline{
    agent{         //the definition where the job is qoing to run
        label "master"      //or "slave"
                            //or you can just the agent "any" also
    }
    tools{  //you can mentioned tools like SonarScanner or Maven or JDK
        maven "Maven"
    }
    environment{  //corresponding environment variables
        NEXUS_VERSION = "nexus3"
        NEXUS_PROTOCOL =
        NEXUS_URL = "youe-ip-addr:8081"
        NEXUS_REPOSITORY = "maven-nexus-repo"
        NEXUS_CREDENTIAL_ID = "nexus-user-credentials"
        ARTIFACT_VERSION = "${env.BUILD_ID}"
    }
    stages{       //what is going to execute in our job
        stage("Clone") {
            ...  //Clone code from VCS
        }
        stage("BuildAndTest"){  //Maven Build
            steps{
                sh "mvn install"
            }
            post{
                success{
                    echo "Now Archiving..."
                    archiveArtifacts artifacts: "**/target/*.war"
                }
            }
        }
        stage("Publish"){  //Publish to Nexus Repository Manager
            steps{
            ...   //
            }
        stage("Deploy"){
            steps{
                  //
            }
            post{
                success{
                    ... //
                }
            }
        }
    }

If you're supposed to put this in the VCS, you should create a file with name 'Jenkinsfile'. But i'm gouin to just execute it from the Jenkins job, so the name doesn't matter.

-----------
    $ vim '140 - Jenkinsfile'
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment{
    JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/"
    }
    stages {
        stage('Fetch code') {
            steps {
                //paac = 'pipeline as a code'
                git branch: 'paac', url: 'https://github.com/devopshydclub/vprofile-project'
            }
        }
        stage('Build'){
            steps {
                sh 'mvn install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
    }
